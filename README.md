# Competitive programing notes

## Introduction

This repository holds all the boilerplate code que that we use during training and actual competitions. All .cpp files are ready to be copied and pasted, including relevant comments. However, for anyone using this repository, we must caution that a good undersating of the code and the theory behind it is needed in order to be efective using it, as it will most likely need some form of modifications for your particular problem.

## Printable version

It is posible to auto generate a .pdf file for print based on all the content on the repository. In order to do this, you must compile the notes.tex file with the -shell-escape flag turned on
